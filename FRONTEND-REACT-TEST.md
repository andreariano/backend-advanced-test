# Front End React+Redux Test

Create a react application for managing super-heroes/villains.

## Business rules

* The user must be able to enter the Name of the Hero, its super-power, its weekness, and whether it is a superhero or a villain
* The user can optionaly identify what is his arch-enemy among the villains
* There should be an option do edit, and delete super-heroes/villains
* Super-heroes and Villains should be in the same list and there should be an identifier whether it is a superhero or a villain

## Non functional requirements

Use React with Redux.

Also, make it easy to deploy/run your service(s) locally (consider using some container/vm solution for this). Once done, share your code with us.
